# *A Dao of Web Design Summary*

The article “A Dao of Web Design” written by John Allsopp compares the aspects of web design to the Chinese philosophy of Daoism, which encourages flexibility and harmony along one’s life path. Allsopp believes that many web pages are clinging too strongly to the ways of printed paper, when they have so much potential to be adapted to a user’s specific needs. This in short is Allsopp’s goal; for the Internet to be comprised of completely adaptive pages. 

One suggestion to reach the goal of a completley adaptive internet is to think about a web page’s function before thinking of its appearance. This will prioritize a smooth browsing experience for web users rather than the designer’s aesthetic hopes and dreams for the appearance of the page. Secondly, Allsopp suggests completely ditching points and pixels. This will allow text and images to be clear on any screen; adapting to both different size monitors and vision impaired viewers. Another way to make a web page adaptable for the viewer is to separate the header from the body, and use the body text size as a percentage of the window instead of a set font size. This will keep the header the same size, but allow the viewer to change the text size based on their preference. 

All of these suggestions create an equal web experience for all viewers; an opportunity we have on the design of web pages that we do not on tangible printed pages.
