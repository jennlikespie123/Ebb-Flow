# ebb & flow
In this first assignment we created a summary of an article, an accompanying illustrtion, and an about the author description, and translated it all into [Markdown](https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/summary.md).

We then converted it into [HTML](https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/summary.html), using Dillinger.

Lastly, we styled the html code with CSS to our liking to create a pleasing finished [product] (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/index.html)
