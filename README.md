# Ebb & Flow
In this first assignment we created a summary of an article, an accompanying illustrtion, and an about the author description, and translated it all into Markdown. This was our first [Draft](https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/summary.md).

We then converted it into HTML using Dillinger. This acted as a [Revision](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/summary.html).

Lastly, we styled the HTML with CSS to our liking to create a pleasing [Final Productâ„¢](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/ebb-flow/blob/master/index.html).
